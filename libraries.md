## 20 Great Python Libraries

1. Matplotlib A must for data analyzing, Matplotlib is a numerical plotting library widely used in the Python scientific computing community.

2. Pandas Pandas provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with structured (tabular, multidimensional, potentially heterogeneous) and time series data both easy and intuitive.

3. Requests Is a must have for any python developers. It allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests, add headers, form data, multipart files, and parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access the response data in the same way.

4. SQLAlchemy Provides a full suite of well-known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.

5. NumPy Provides advance math functionalities and a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

6. Pyglet Provides an object-oriented programming interface for developing games and other visually-rich applications for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. This is the engine in which the popular game Minecraft was made.

7. BeautifulSoup It may be slow but itâ€™s xml and html parsing library is very useful for beginners.

8. SciPy SciPy is one of the core packages that make up the SciPy stack. It provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization.

9. Pygame Pygame provides a very easy to use and powerful Python interface to the Simple Directmedia Library (SDL) platform independent graphic, audio and input libraries.

10. Scrapy Provides a fast high-level screen scraping and web crawling framework. It can be used for a wide range of purposes, from data mining to monitoring and automated testing.

11. Twisted Twisted is an event-driven networking engine written in Python and licensed under the open source MIT license. Twisted runs on Python 2 and an ever growing subset also works with Python 3.

12. Pillow A friendly fork of PIL (Python Imaging Library). It is more user friendly than PIL and is a must have for anyone who works with images.

13. wxPython WxPython is a wrapper around wxWidgets for the Python language.

14. Pywin32 Pywin32 is a python library which provides some useful methods and classes for interacting with windows.

15. iPython Based on an architecture that provides parallel and distributed computing. IPython enables parallel applications to be developed, executed, debugged and monitored interactively.

16. Nose Provides an alternate test discovery and running process for unittest, one that is intended to mimic the behavior of py.test as much as is reasonably possible without resorting to too much magic.

17. PyGTK Lets you to easily create programs with a graphical user interface using the Python programming language.

18. Flask Flask is a Python web framework built with a small core and many extensions.

19. SymPy SymPy is an open source Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries.

20. Fabric Fabric is a Python library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks. It provides a basic suite of operations for executing local or remote shell commands and uploading/downloading files, as well as auxiliary functionality such as prompting the running user for input, or aborting execution
